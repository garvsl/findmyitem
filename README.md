# Shopverse

## Problem
Have you ever been in a grocery store feeling completely lost? Now imagine navigating that same store if you're visually impairedâ€”it can be overwhelming. On top of that, how often do we really know the environmental impact of our purchases? It's challenging to shop mindfully when so much information is missing.

## Vision
We envisioned a shopping experience that is both accessible and eco-friendlyâ€”a tool that not only helps you find what you need with ease but also informs you about the environmental cost of your choices. Picture having a knowledgeable friend by your side, guiding you to make decisions that are good for you and the planet.

## Solution
Meet Shopverse: an AR-guided mobile app that transforms the way you shop. With voice-assisted directions, Shopverse makes navigating grocery aisles simple and stress-free, even for the visually impaired. It displays each item's carbon footprint and suggests greener alternatives so you can shop with confidence and care. Shopverse is shopping reimagined for a sustainable, inclusive future.
